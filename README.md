## Video Frame Prediction Using ResNet50

This project uses a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to predict the class of objects in each frame of a given video. The results are displayed on the video in real-time.

This repository contains a script that processes a video file, extracts frames, and uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify objects in each frame. The predicted class is overlaid on the video in real-time.

## Features
- Load and process video files
- Extract frames and save them temporarily
- Use ResNet50 to predict the class of objects in frames
- Overlay predictions on the video
- Display the processed video with predictions in real-time
